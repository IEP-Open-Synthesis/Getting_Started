# Getting Started
A Guide for the Very Beginner

## Introduction
If you're a scientst who is working on a project in the IEP Work Plan, you might consider creating a GitHub repository to share your progress and products. Here, we try to share some resources to help you get started. Of course, you're welcome to use any tools that make sense for you, your research group, and/or your agency. These are just some of the open source tools that IEP researchers are using.

## Tasks Before You Get Started:
1. If you don't already have one, __set up your GitHub Account__:  https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/ 
   * It is good practice to use a professional string for your user name that your colleagues will be able to use to easily idenfity you.
1. You may also want to check your agency/organization/school's policies on data sharing rights and requirements.

## Resources
Open science isn't just one thing. It's up to each team to decide how open they want their process to be and what's practical for their project. Teams may decide to start with proprietary tools and move towards more open tools in the future. Below are a few resources on open tools. We may update these from time to time as we find new and useful tools or resources.
